            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a student and self-taught researcher with a strong interest in technology, programming, and the development of creative solutions applied to everyday life. My goal is to continuously improve my technical and theoretical knowledge by combining hands-on practice with ongoing study to build a solid foundation in the fields I have chosen to explore. I value critical thinking, organization, and adaptability as essential pillars for academic and professional growth.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, I am focused on studying programming languages and developing personal organization methods based on gamification and productivity principles. I strive to apply concepts of logic, design, and usability in small experimental projects while deepening my theoretical understanding through reading, coursework, and content creation. This approach allows me to build interdisciplinary skills with a focus on innovation, analysis, and autonomy.</p>

            <p>This website serves as a space to document and share part of my academic and personal journey, functioning as a portfolio of experiences, studies, and projects. I hope this space contributes to my intellectual growth and acts as a bridge for dialogue with other students, researchers, and professionals interested in technology, education, and creativity.</p>
